Design goal

Description:
A timer that prompts the user on startup to enter the duration of the timer in minutes.
After hitting enter, it will automatically start the timer. When the time is up it will
play a choosen sound as the alarm to alert the user and prompt the user whether he/she
wants to restart the timer or enter a new duration.

Ideas
The user can choose between two modes: Hardcore mode, which won't let the user restart
the timer unless 5 minutes after the alarm has gone off have passed.
Easy Mode will let you restart the timer at any time.
